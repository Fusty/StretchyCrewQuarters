	description = Using a new and improved formula of the regular StretchyTank material, this SuperStretchyTank can stretch in width in addition to length. This one is designed for storage of cryogenic fuels like Liquid H2, and has more insulation than a regular tank (only matters for Real Fuels). In addition, this tank uses its pressure tanks as its outer layer, which means you can fit more fuel in, it's lighter (if using Real Fuels mod), but it is also more fragile.
