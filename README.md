StretchyCrewQuarters
====================

Fork of AncientGammoner's StretchyTanks, modified to create Stretchable Crew Quarters or Crew Tanks

##Planned Features
- Moveable/scalable Hatch : Within sane limits, and perhaps a couple styles of hatch
- Moveable/scalable windows : maybe a couple styles, maybe not.  Procedural IVA would get tough with this, probably not gunna work with IVA.
- All the features you expect from Stretchy Tanks except storing fuel or changing fuel type, obviously
- Different textures
- Different end-cap styles, adapters, docking port option.
